# Embedding Explorer
In my work I regularly find myself having to explain the concept of vector embeddings to non-technical folks, and I have found that a good visualization goes a long way. What's better than a nice illustration, though? An interactive tool, of course! 

## The Cool Technical Details
This project leverages @xenova/@huggingface's amazing transformers.js library to run entirely client-side, in the user's browser. 

## The Boring Technical Details
This project is set up as a basic React application

## What's Next?

- Add a more detailed history of embeddings
- Provide examples
- Allowing embedding model selection
- Allowing embedding model comparison
- "Sliding window" visualization (animated plot looping over all embedding space dimensions)
- Using LLM to generate plausible axis labels
- Table display of more dimensions with plausible labels
